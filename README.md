# Module 14 Challenge

Assignment by: Octavio Pinedo

App Dashboard Link: Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard

Belly Button Challenge (JavaScript, Plotly, D3.js)

In this assignment, we built an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.
We used the D3 library to read the dataset from https://2u-data-curriculum-team.s3.amazonaws.com/dataviz-classroom/v1.1/14-Interactive-Web-Visualizations/02-Homework/samples.json. For the data visualizations, we used Plotly to create a bar chart to display the top 10 OTUs found in each Test Subject, a bubble chart to display further details about the OTUs found, and a gauge chart to plot the weekly washing frequency of the individual. Furthermore, we also created a Metadata table to show each Test Subject's demographic information.
